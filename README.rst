File Tree Subs
==============

Allows to synchronize a destination file tree from a source file tree
while allowing certain substitutions to take place.

File Tree Subs uses `doit <http://pydoit.org/>`__ under the hood to keep
track of changes, so that files are only changed if necessary.

See the following three examples for typical use cases of
``filetreesubs``. I'm personally using it to preprocess the output of
`Nikola <https://getnikola.com/>`__, a static blog/site generator, to
insert a sidebar into all generated HTML pages, and a tag cloud into
the sidebar and the tag overview page.

To install, use ``pip install filetreesubs``.


Example
-------

Assume you have the following file tree::

    input/
        index.html
        team.html
        products.html
        menu.inc
        testimonials.inc

In the ``.html`` files, you put placeholder strings ``INSERT_MENU_HERE`` for where
the content of ``input/menu.inc`` should be inserted, and ``INSERT_TESTIMONIALS``
for where the content of ``input/testimonials.inc`` should be inserted. Also, you
want ``COPYRIGHT_YEAR`` to be replaced by 2017. The result should be a tree like
this, without the ``.inc`` files::

    output/
        index.html
        team.html
        products.html

with the placeholder string replaced. To do this with ``filetreesubs``, create a
config file ``filetreesubs-config.yaml``::

    # Source directory
    source: input
    # Destination directory
    destination: output
    substitutes:
      # The following is a regular expression to match the filenames:
      '.*\.html':
        # The strings to replace
        'INSERT_MENU_HERE':
          # With what to replace them
          file: menu.inc
        'INSERT_TESTIMONIALS':
          file: testimonials.inc
        'COPYRIGHT_YEAR':
          text: '2017'

Then running ``filetreesubs`` will synchornize ``output/`` so that it contains
the files from ``input/``, except ``menu.inc``, and makes sure the substitutions
take place.


Example: Sidebar in Nikola
--------------------------

You can find an example site for Nikola using the `sidebar plugin <https://plugins.getnikola.com/v7/sidebar/>`__
in `the Github repository felixfontein/filetreesubs-nikola-demo <https://github.com/felixfontein/filetreesubs-nikola-demo/>`__.

A more complex, but less explicit example can be found `in my blog <https://spielwiese.fontein.de/2017/01/06/static-sidebar-and-tag-cloud/>`__,
which also includes a tag cloud (rendered by the `static_tag_cloud pugin <https://plugins.getnikola.com/v7/static_tag_cloud/>`__)
into the sidebar.


Example: Substitution chains
----------------------------

Assume that in the above example, you want to use ``INSERT_TESTIMONIALS`` also in
``menu.inc`` itself. Running the above example, this substitution will not be done,
also if you extend the regular expression matching all HTML files to ``.*`` to
match all files.

To apply substitutions to included files, you need to use substitution chains.
Append the following to the configuration above::

    substitute_chains:
    - template: menu.inc
      substitutes:
        'INSERT_TESTIMONIALS':
          file: testimonials.inc

This will apply the substitution for ``INSERT_TESTIMONIALS`` also to ``menu.inc``.


Example: Creating index files
-----------------------------

Assume that you have folder structure::

    input/
        index.html
        images/
            logo.jpeg
            2017/
                happynewyear-2017.jpeg

You want to upload the output to a web server so it is available under
``http://example.com``, but if someone accesses ``http://example.com/images/``
or ``http://example.com/images/2017/``, you don't want the persons to see a
file listing or some error page, but show them a nice message to check out
the home page. You can use ``filetreesubs`` for this. Add the following
to the configuration::

    create_index_filename: index.html
    create_index_content: |
      <!DOCTYPE html>
      <html>
        <head>
          <title>There's nothing to see here.</title>
          <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="10; url=..">
        </head>
        <body>
          There's nothing to see here. Go <a href="..">here</a> instead.
          You will be automatically redirected there in 10 seconds.
        </body>
      </html>

Then in every folder not containing a file ``index.html``, a file
``index.html`` will be created with the specified content.


Configuration file format
-------------------------

The configuration file is in `YAML format <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML>`__.
By default, the configuration is assumed to be in ``filetreesubs-config.yaml``
in the current directory. If you want to specify a different configuration file
name, you can simply specify it on the command line::

    filetreesubs my-config-file.yaml

The following commented YAML file shows all available options::

    # The source directory. Specify a path here.
    source: input

    # The destination directory. Specify a path here.
    destination: output

    # The substitutions to make
    substitutes:
      # For every substitution, you need to specify a regex pattern
      # matching the file name. Use '.*' to match everything, and
      # '.*\.html' to match all files ending with '.html'.
      '.*':
        # Now you can specify a number of strings which shall be replaced
        'STRING TO REPLACE':
          # In this case, we want to replace the string by the contents
          # of the file menu.inc. Note that menu.inc won't be copied
          # to the destination directory anymore.
          file: menu.inc
        'ANOTHER_REPLACEMENT_STRING':
          # In this case, we want to replace the string by another string
          # we explicitly specify here.
          text: '(replacement text)'
      # Now we can specify more filename matching patterns ...
      '.*\.html':
        # ... and more replacements
        'YET_ANOTHER_STRING':
          text: '(some more)'

    # To do substitutions in files like menu.inc, we need substitution
    # chains.
    substitute_chains:
    # Each substitution chain consists of the name of the file to
    # substitute in, like menu.inc:
    - template: menu.inc
      # As well as a list of substitutions, using the same syntax as above:
      substitutes:
        # The string to replace:
        'INCLUDE_INCLUDE':
          # What to replace it with
          file: include.inc
        'INCLUDE_STRING':
          text: '...'
    # You can have as many substitution chains as you want
    - template: include.inc
      substitutes:
        'ONE_MORE':
          text: '(...)'

    # To create index files (when not already existing), you must
    # specify the name of these files:
    create_index_filename: index.html

    # This allows to specify the content of index files.
    create_index_content: |
      <!DOCTYPE html>
      <html lang="en">
        <head>
          <title>there's nothing to see here.</title>
          <meta name="robots" content="noindex">
          <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url=..">
        </head>
        <body style="background-color:black; color:white;">
          <div style="position:absolute; top:0; left:0; right:0; bottom:0;">
            <div style="width:100%; height:100%; display:table;">
                there's nothing to see here. go <a href=".." style="color:#AAA;">here</a> instead.
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
        </body>
      </html>

    # By default, filetreesubs assumes that all text files it processes
    # are UTF-8 encoded. If that's not the case, you can change another
    # encoding here.
    encoding: utf-8

    # In case you need to do so, you can insert configurations for doit
    # directly here. See `here <http://pydoit.org/configuration.html#configuration-at-dodo-py>`__
    # for possible configurations.
    doit_config:
      # The following option sets the filename for the dependency database.
      # If you want to execute different filetreesubs commands concurrently
      # from a folder, you need to specify different dependency database
      # names per project config.
      dep_file: '.doit-myproject.db'
